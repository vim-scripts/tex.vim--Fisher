     This is an updated version of the file ftplugin/tex.vim included in the
standard vim distribution.  It sets options appropriately for editing TeX
(especially LaTeX) files.  It is fairly conservative:  it may not do everything
you want, but it will probably not do anything to annoy you.

     This will set the buffer-local variable b:tex_flavor to "tex" (for plain TeX)
 or "latex".  Other mappings, plugins, etc. may use this variable to modify
their behavior.
